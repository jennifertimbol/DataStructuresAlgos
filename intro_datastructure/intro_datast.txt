Fundamental data structures, stores collection of value stored in index
Index: position in Array
Lists can be different from an Array depending on language
Contiguous data structure

2. Linked Lists
Linear data structure, element in list contained in separate object called Node
Self referential Objects
Head node, Tail node

2 Forms of linked lists:
Singly Linked List- points to the right, reference to the next
Doubly Linked list- reference to the one before and after

3. Merge Sorting
Divide and conquer algorithm
Splitting up problems, keep splitting until down to single arrays and merging them back together
Implement in Singly Linked
